# Model Stacking Workbench

## Purpose
This is a collection of Python modules that facilitate building "a predicitve
model" for [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com) using a generalized 
model stacking approach.   This approach involves developing 
several predictive models and combining predictions from those models into
an overall prediction. Generally speaking the combination of predictions lead to
a better performing model.

This version of the workbench supports supports using model algorithms from scikit-learn and
xgboost for regression and classification problems.  Future releases expand to 
handle regression problems and incorporate algorithms from other Python packages, such as
TensorFlow, and R.
